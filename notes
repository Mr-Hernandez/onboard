I think I will try to implement some mems from on board the stm32 device.

To set up an interrupt do the following
- Set EXTI's FTSR or RTSR for falling, rising, or both edge detection
NOTE: what if EXTI line isn't used, say spi, or i2c and such.
- Enable SYSCFG clock
- set SYSCFG's EXTICR to corresponding GPIO port
- set EXTI 's IMR to enable interrupt on pin number
j
- set NVIC_ISERx to coressponding IRQ number
- You can set priority of irqnumber here
- create the interrupt function to overtake the weak startup function
- clear corresponding pending bit in EXTI->PR in the function call
